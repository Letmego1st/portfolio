Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

For this challenge I wrote the HTML and CSS for a sample professional portfolio which will be added to over time to become my own personal portfolio of work. I used what I learned in the prework and first three weeks of bootcamp to write the HTML and CSS from scratch, while keeping in mind the following requirements:

The Site is divided into several sections, including About Me, My Work, and Contact Info.
I included functioning navigation links at the top of the page to take the user to any of the sections
I will later include a link to my resume.
I included a recent photo of myself.
The projects presented in the My Work section include a couple of sample programs I have worked on for the bootcamp as well as some placeholder applications that will be added to as I complete more applications in the bootcamp and on my own.
The non-placholder applications will take the user to the deployed application on my GitHub when clicked on.
The page was styled for multiple screen sizes, including tablets and mobile phones.

Link to deployed application:
