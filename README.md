# Portfolio
## John Elmore: Professional Portfolio

For this challenge I wrote the HTML and CSS for a sample professional portfolio which will be added to over time to become my own personal portfolio of work. I used what I learned in the prework and first three weeks of bootcamp to write the HTML and CSS from scratch, while keeping in mind the following requirements:

The Site is divided into several sections, including About Me, Projects, and Contact Info.
I included functioning navigation links at the top of the page to take the user to any of the sections
I will also include a link to my resume as the end of the course approaches.

The projects presented in the Projects section include a couple of sample programs I have worked on for the bootcamp as well as some placeholder applications that will be added to as I complete more applications in the bootcamp and on my own.
The page was also styled for multiple screen sizes, including tablets and mobile phones.
