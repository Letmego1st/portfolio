# Portfolio
## John Elmore: Professional Portfolio

For my professional portfolio, I meticulously developed a sample website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which serves as a foundation for my future personal portfolio. Leveraging the knowledge and skills acquired during the prework and initial three weeks of the bootcamp, I crafted the HTML, CSS, & JavaScript code entirely from scratch, adhering to the following criteria:

* Structured Sections: My website is thoughtfully organized into distinct sections, encompassing essential components such as "About Me," "Projects," and "Contact Info."

* Seamless Navigation: To enhance user experience, I implemented fully functional navigation links at the top of the page, allowing visitors to effortlessly navigate to any desired section of the website.

* Resume Inclusion: As I progress through the course, I plan to incorporate a prominent link to my comprehensive resume, ensuring that prospective stakeholders have access to my professional background and achievements.

* Comprehensive Project Showcase: Within the "Projects" section, I showcase a diverse array of programming endeavors. This includes exemplary projects completed during the bootcamp, as well as preliminary applications that will be continuously expanded upon as I tackle further challenges both within the bootcamp curriculum and independently.

* Responsive Design: Recognizing the significance of optimal user experience across various devices, I diligently tailored the website's styling to accommodate multiple screen sizes, including tablets and mobile phones.

* By adhering to these meticulous standards, I aim to present a polished and dynamic portfolio that showcases my skills and accomplishments as I progress in my professional journey.
